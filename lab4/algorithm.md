Using valid HTML5 markup, CSS rules and JavaScript code covered in lessons 1 thru 8, create a web page (aesthetically styled with an external CSS file) that is linked to an external JavaScript file which contains JavaScript code to prompt the user for their birth month and day and then uses this information to calculate how many days until their next birthday. Display the following to the web page visitor:

The number of days until the visitors next birthday.
The date (including the week day) of the visitor's next birthday. //Saturday, November 4, 2017

Prompt user for birth month and day
- option that I can use radio button/ or just calender

birthDayMonth 
birthDayDate

Get current date (year/month/day)
currentYear
currentMonth
currentDay

If currentMonth/currentDay > birthDayMonth / birthDayDate
   nextBirthDay = currentYear / birthDayMonth / birthDayDate

else if currentMonth/currentDay < birthDayMonth / birthDayDate
   nextBirthDay = currentYear + 1/ birthDayMonth / birthDayDate
   numberOfDays = current date - nextBirthDay + 1
